In this programming paradigm, the code is structured linearly and makes extensive use of functions and a succession of steps to execute the program. In the example below, a single function is used to first collect user inputs, perform a calculation, and print an output statement. The function is called once, triggering the actions to occur. Inside the function, the steps are processed sequentially."

        "In contrast with procedural programming, the OOP paradigm relies on the construction and interaction of entities called objects. This strategy has the advantage of reusability due to the use of object templates called classes. Let's look at an example for some clarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you are designing software to help model the biodiversity of the forest. As you can imagine, there would be many types of plants, animals, fungi, and microbes living together. Programming each of the individuals would be difficult and by using high-level classes for each of these major organism types, you could create a template for each to contain their shared properties.\n",

        "##### Example 1: Forest Biodiversity\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, a `Plant` class would have its inputs defined as sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. Its output would be oxygen and sugar. Another shared characteristic that could be defined in this class is a plant's preferred light environment such as full shade, partial shade, partial sun, or full sun. All of these characteristics are known as attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each \"instance\" of the `Plant` class (of which there could be many) could then differ from each other instance. For example, while oak trees and ferns could be instances of the `Plant` class, and share characteristics common among most plants, the lighting requirements for each would take a different value with oaks preferring full sun and ferns preferring full shade. Do you see how the instances relate to the class? The same approach would be used for each other organism type with several important classes and many instances of those classes for each individual.\n",

        "\n",
        "The concept of instances being derived from classes is quite powerful and perhaps familiar to you if you have any experience with video games. Individual enemy character instances might belong to the class `Enemy` and share characteristics like `health_level` and `damage_level` but the `boss_enemy` might have a much higher value for each of those attributes than the lower-level common enemies. The OOP paradigm is strong for this type of application because it allows the code to be more easily maintained. For example, if all enemies needed a new attribute, the modification could be made to the parent `Enemy` class and it would be inherited by all instances of that class.\n",
